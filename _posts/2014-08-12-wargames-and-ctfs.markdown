One great way to practice your skills in the pentesting world is to participate in wargames and CTFs.  You can play wargames on sites like [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/) or [SmashTheStack](http://www.smashthestack.org/), take part in sanctioned CTFs such as those through [CTF365](http://ctf365.com/), or setup your own lab at home and play around in it.

This afternoon I thought it'd be fun to play a quick wargame and decided there might be some educational benefit to others by sharing my notes.  The game I chose was `Leviathan` on OverTheWire, it's fairly easy but a good starting point for those new to this and a fun hour or so for those not so new.
